## Custom LaunchBar Actions

### Copy POSIX Path

Copies the POSIX path of a selected file or directory to the clipboard

1. Select a file or a folder in Finder window
2. Press and hold `Command + Space` (or your LaunchBar shortcut)
3. Press `Tab` key and enter `posix` to select **Copy POSIX Path**
4. Paste the POSIX path in your text editor

### Love Current Track

Favorite the currently playing music

If favorite of the current track is false, set the favorite of the current track to true. Otherwise, set the favorite of the current track to false.

### Make New Action

Make a new action in OmniFocus inbox

> OmniFocus actually has a quick entry shortcut so I'm not using this custom action anymore.

### Make New Reading Action

Add the current Safari window/tab to the Reading List

> You can actually do this in Safari by choosing **Add to Reading List** (`Command + Shift + D`).

### New Web Archive in Yojimbo

Create a new web archive in Yojimbo from the current Safari window/tab.

LaunchBar and Yojimbo already provides this service. But my custom action allows you to enter tags.
